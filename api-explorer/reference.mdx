Currently, we can generate a full spec from the existing openapi.json file, but this excludes tag descriptions. As a result, we need to add these to docs.json manually.

TODO:

- Add a group for each missing tag.
- Add a description page for each tag.
- Paste in the tag description from the Markdown file.
- Add endpoints for each tag. Remember to point to the openapi.json file.
