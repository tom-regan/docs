An **account group** is an individual entry within an account grouping. The lowest-level category for each account group
must be mapped
to [MindBridge Account Classification (MAC) codes](https://support.mindbridge.ai/hc/en-us/articles/22819163288343-MindBridge-Account-Classification-code-system-MAC-v-2),
and optionally, assigned account tags for further classification.

Account groups can be updated as needed until the account grouping is published. Once published, existing account groups
cannot be updated, but new account groups can be added to the account grouping using the `append` endpoint.
