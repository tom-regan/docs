title: 'Account Grouping'
---

An **account grouping** is a custom financial hierarchy that MindBridge uses to interpret accounts and the relationships
between them, and defines how accounts are aggregated and presented in analysis results across the MindBridge platform
and reports. When you create an account grouping, you must map account groups
to [MindBridge Account Classification (MAC) codes](https://support.mindbridge.ai/hc/en-us/articles/22819163288343-MindBridge-Account-Classification-code-system-MAC-v-2).
This mapping enables MindBridge to effectively analyze datasets across any engagements and analyses that use a given
account grouping.

## Creating a new account grouping

To create a new account grouping, import a
completed [MACv2_AccountGroupingTemplate](https://support.mindbridge.ai/hc/en-us/articles/22819163288343)* Excel file or
a _CCH group trial balance_ file as a chunked file. Import the new file using the `/import-from-chunked-file` endpoint.
This action will create a new account grouping entry and a complete set of account groups and MAC mappings, as defined
in the imported file.

***Note:** The exportable template is located at the bottom of the linked article. Once you have the template, follow
the steps linked here to [create a new account grouping](https://support.mindbridge.ai/hc/en-us/articles/360056330754).

## Appending to an existing account grouping

To append to an existing account grouping, export the most current version of your MindBridge account grouping, then add
new account groups to the bottom of the account grouping, starting from the first empty row. Next, save the file and
import it as a chunked file, then import the new file using the `/append-from-chunked-file` endpoint. This action will
add the new account groups and mappings to the end of the existing account grouping.

**Note:** _CCH group trial balance_ files may not be used when appending to an existing account grouping.

## Publishing an account grouping

Account groupings must be published before they can be added to a library. In order to be published, errors must be
resolved for all account groups within the account grouping, and the lowest-level account categories for each account
group must be mapped to a MAC code. To publish an account grouping, set the `publishStatus` field to `PUBLISHED`.

Upon publishing, all the account groups within the account grouping are finalized and can no longer be updated, however
the account grouping can still be appended to. Appending will change the account grouping’s `publishStatus`
to `UNPUBLISHED_CHANGES`.

From the `UNPUBLISHED_CHANGES`, the account grouping can be re-published after fixing all account group errors, then
updating the `publishStatus` field to `PUBLISHED`.
