## Proof of concept

This is the demo Mintlify site we arranged for MindBridge. I took the proposed site map
Tom provided, created some stub pages, and hooked up some API endpoints, and the webhook specs
in the Webhooks section.

This page is the landing page for the site, so we can place anything we want here.

All pages boil down to Markdown, with some added metadata and added features. We can hopefully
migrate any Markdown file easily, and other files without too much effort. Then we can start
taking advantage of some features.
