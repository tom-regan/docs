title: "Updating documentation"
---

This page explains how we would update documentation or add pages to the
Mintlify site.

Every page in Mintlify is an mdx file in the site's folder structure. MDX is
Markdown supplanted with JSX, to allow for metadata, and added features.

Each pages starts with a metadata section, including at least a title, and
other fields as appropriate. The following is the start of this file:

``` mdx
---
Title: "Updating documentation"
---
```

The rest of the document can contain the text in Markdown format. It is
similar to HTML, but instead of having `<tags>`, you have text and spacing based
controls to define how things are displayed.

A cheatsheet is available at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/markdown-cheat-sheet/

Once a new page is created, it must be added to the site map.

The docs.json file defines the structure of the site, and all of its pages.

The `navigation` object defines all the tabs that appear on the top of the
site. Each tab can contain one or more groups, and each group can contain 
pages or subgroups.

To add a page, find the section you want to add it to, and add a reference
to the new page, including the full folder structure.

```
{
    "group": "How to document",
    "icon": "book-open",
    "pages": [
        "getting-started/updating-documentation",
        "getting-started/your-new-page-here"
    ]
}
```

Once the changes are made, you will need to commit the changes to the
repository. This is handled using git, so some familiarity with git is needed.

Once we add and convert new pages, we can update this document with info
that would be helpful for editors.
